                        Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end library for designing websites and web applications.
                        It contains HTML and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions.
                        Unlike many web frameworks, it concerns itself with front-end development only.

                        Bootstrap is the second most-starred project on GitHub, with more than 122,000 stars.

                        Bootstrap is modular and consists of a series of Less stylesheets that implement the various components of the toolkit. These stylesheets are generally compiled into a bundle and included in web pages, but individual components can be included or removed. Bootstrap provides a number of configuration variables that control things such as color and padding of various components.

                        Since Bootstrap 2, the Bootstrap documentation has included a customization wizard which generates a customized version of Bootstrap based on the requested components and various settings.

                        As of Bootstrap 4, Sass is used instead of Less for the stylesheets.

                        Each Bootstrap component consists of an HTML structure, CSS declarations, and in some cases accompanying JavaScript code.

                        Grid system and responsive design comes standard with an 1170 pixel wide grid layout. Alternatively, the developer can use a variable-width layout. For both cases, the toolkit has four variations to make use of different resolutions and types of devices: mobile phones, portrait and landscape, tablets and PCs with low and high resolution. Each variation adjusts the width of the columns.
